# Exporting to Godot

1. Open an existing project
2. Drag and drop the GLTF file inside the FileSystem panel (preferably in a folder you want it)
3. Accept the defaults
4. Drag and drop the GLTF node into your scene (looks like a movie clip icon).

To play the animation, create a script on a node somewhere (I just picked the top-most node).

You can play the animation whenever, but Iâ€™ll be playing it here when the level loads immediately using the `on_ready()` Node method.

```python
extends Node3D

# Runs when the level loads
func _on_ready() -> void:
	# Sanity check
	#print("running")

	# Grab the GLTF model. I made it a "Unique Name"
	var animation_player = %Ryoturia.get_node("AnimationPlayer") as AnimationPlayer

	# Play the animation, usually labeled "Scene"
	# You can open the GLTF node and check the name inside the AnimationPlayer
	animation_player.play("Scene")

	pass
```
