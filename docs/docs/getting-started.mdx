## 🔰 How to use

![The plugin panel inside Blender](/screenshots/plugin-panel.jpg)

1. Open up the side panel labeled **"MIDI Importer"**, it's available in the 3D viewport in the n-panel (the right side panel that's usually collapsed). Click the little arrow on the top right or press `CTRL/CMD + ]` to expand the n-panel and find the **MIDI Import** tab.
1. Select a MIDI file you'd like to import.
1. Assign 3D objects to piano keys.
1. Click the button labeled **"Generate Keyframes"**

> Not happy with the animation? You can undo the keyframes (`CTRL/CMD + Z`). Can't undo? Try the **"Delete All Keyframes"** button, it will delete **_all_** keyframes on any selected note object.
