# Tips and Tricks

## Auto Assigning Keys

The plugin can automatically assign piano keys if you create a collection with objects with the note letter appended to the end.

For example, you'd name your objects something like:

- `ObjectName.C` maps to the `C` piano key
- `yourobject.F#` maps to the `F#` piano key

Then you can select the collection and press the **"Auto-Assign Keys" button**.

:::warning
We currently only support 1 octave at a time, so you don't need to put `C4` vs `C5`. The plugin will detect the first `C` key it finds in the collection.

## Deleting all keyframes or actions

Didn't like the results of an animation and want to reset? Undo should work if you did the keyframe generation recently.

But if undo doesn't work, you can use the **"Delete All Keyframes"** button on the bottom of the plugin in the aptly named **"Danger Zone".** This will delete all keyframes on any piano key objects you have assigned.

This does not delete all keyframes across all objects globally - only those explicitly selected in the plugin.

If you have multiple sets of keys (like octaves or different types of buttons) you'll have to use the "Auto-Assign Keys" to select each set to delete them from each set.

## Visualizing the MIDI Track

I'd recommend downloading [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to visualize the MIDI tracks and see what the note charts look like before you import them into Blender.

## FPS and Music Timing

When creating the animation keyframes, we use the current scene's frame rate to calculate the music time. If you **change the frame rate** after generating keyframes, you should **re-generate keyframes** to ensure the timing is correct.
