The plugin can automatically assign piano keys if you create a collection with objects with the note letter appended to the end.

For example, you'd name your objects something like:

- `ObjectName.C` maps to the `C` piano key
- `yourobject.F#` maps to the `F#` piano key

Then you can select the collection and press the **"Auto-Assign Keys" button**.

We have [example files](/docs/resources/example-files) in the Resources section that show how to name your piano key objects.
